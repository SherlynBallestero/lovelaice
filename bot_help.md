I can transcribe audio messages for you and store them as text notes. You can send one or multiple audios to a single note.

Start by sending an audio message, which will create a new note. After the transcription is finished, you can send more audios to continue the same note, or create new notes.

Send /list to see all stored notes.

In your message, you can use voice commands to do some formatting. For example, try saying "title, here is a title" or "heading, this is a heading" and the corresponding text will be formatted as title or heading in markdown (using # or ##).

You can also say "begin list", "end list" and the items you say in between will be formatted as a list. Also works with "(begin / end) ordered list" and "(begin / end) to-do list".
